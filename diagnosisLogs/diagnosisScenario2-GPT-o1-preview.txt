#### **Violation 1:**
- **Violation Type:** UoC (Usage of Control)
- **Parent Task ID and Name:** Unnamed (Activity_1pfd2dv)
- **Subtask ID and Name:** Make a decision about project (Activity_0bcw6ho)
- **User(s) Involved:** technician2
- **Instance:** 2

##### **Reason for Occurrence:**

In instance 2, user **technician2** executed the task **"Make a decision about project"** (Activity_0bcw6ho) **three times**, exceeding the maximum allowed threshold of **2 executions** as specified by the UoC constraint in the parent task **Unnamed** (Activity_1pfd2dv).

From the **simulation log**:

- At **startTime=197**, **technician2** performed **"Make a decision about project"**.
- The task's **numberOfExecutions** is recorded as **3**.

According to the **BPMN diagram**, **Activity_1pfd2dv** is a service task with a UoC constraint (`security:securityType="UoC"`, `security:Mth="2"`) and specifies **"Make a decision about project"** as its subtask. The UoC rule dictates that a user should not execute the subtask more than the maximum threshold (mth), which is **2** in this case.

##### **Suggested Fix:**

1. **Reassign Tasks to Other Users:**
   - Assign some instances of **"Make a decision about project"** to other qualified users within the **Technical Department**, such as **technician1**, **technician3**, or **technician4**, to prevent any single user from exceeding the execution limit.

2. **Adjust Scheduling to Distribute Workload:**
   - Review the task scheduling to ensure that workloads are evenly distributed among available users, reducing the likelihood of a single user exceeding the UoC threshold due to availability constraints.

3. **Increase UoC Threshold (If Appropriate):**
   - If it is operationally necessary for **technician2** to execute the task more than twice, consider increasing the **mth** value in the UoC constraint of **Activity_1pfd2dv** to a higher number that reflects the practical requirements.

#### **Violation 2:**
- **Violation Type:** BoD (Binding of Duty)
- **Parent Task ID and Name:** Unnamed (Activity_1xtsdxu)
- **Subtask 1 ID and Name:** Fill out project application (Activity_1lsjzdf)
- **Subtask 2 ID and Name:** Finish the project (Activity_0rhq2zz)
- **Users Involved:** company1 and company2
- **Instance:** 1

##### **Reason for Occurrence:**

In instance 1, the **Binding of Duty** constraint on **Unnamed** (Activity_1xtsdxu) requires that both **"Fill out project application"** (Activity_1lsjzdf) and **"Finish the project"** (Activity_0rhq2zz) be executed by the **same user**. However, these tasks were performed by different users:

- **company1** executed **"Fill out project application"** at **startTime=0**.
- **company2** executed **"Finish the project"** at **startTime=273**.

From the **simulation log**:

- **[Task, name=Fill out project application, id_bpmn=Activity_1lsjzdf, userTask=company1, instance=1]**
- **[Task, name=Finish the project, id_bpmn=Activity_0rhq2zz, userTask=company2, instance=1]**

According to the **BPMN diagram**, **Activity_1xtsdxu** is a service task with a BoD constraint (`security:securityType="BoD"`), linking **"Fill out project application"** and **"Finish the project"**. The BoD rule mandates that both tasks must be performed by the same user to maintain consistency and accountability.

##### **Suggested Fix:**

1. **Enforce Consistent User Assignment:**
   - Implement logic in the task assignment system to ensure that the user who starts the project application (**"Fill out project application"**) is the same user who finishes the project (**"Finish the project"**) in each instance.

2. **Modify Task Assignment Policies:**
   - Update assignment policies to prioritize assigning the same user to both tasks unless exceptional circumstances prevent it.

3. **Enhance Communication Between Departments:**
   - Improve coordination between the teams responsible for assigning tasks to ensure adherence to BoD constraints.

#### **Violation 3:**
- **Violation Type:** UoC (Usage of Control)
- **Parent Task ID and Name:** Unnamed (Activity_1pfd2dv)
- **Subtask ID and Name:** Make a decision about project (Activity_0bcw6ho)
- **User(s) Involved:** allLane2
- **Instance:** 3

##### **Reason for Occurrence:**

In instance 3, user **allLane2** executed **"Make a decision about project"** (Activity_0bcw6ho) **three times**, exceeding the UoC constraint of **2 maximum executions** set in the parent task **Unnamed** (Activity_1pfd2dv).

From the **simulation log**:

- At **startTime=305**, **allLane2** performed **"Make a decision about project"**.
- The **Total number of executions (accumulated)** for **allLane2** is **3**.

The **BPMN diagram** indicates that **Activity_1pfd2dv** has a UoC constraint (`security:Mth="2"`) on its subtask **"Make a decision about project"**, limiting the number of executions per user.

##### **Suggested Fix:**

1. **Distribute Executions Among Users:**
   - Assign some executions of **"Make a decision about project"** to other users like **technician1**, **technician3**, or other qualified personnel to comply with the UoC constraint.

2. **Adjust User Workload:**
   - Evaluate the workload on **allLane2** to prevent over-assignment that leads to UoC violations.

3. **Review UoC Threshold:**
   - If business processes require a single user to perform the task more frequently, consider increasing the **mth** value in the UoC constraint after assessing the risks.

- **Instance:** 1

##### **Reason for Occurrence:**

User **evaluator2** executed **"Evaluate project quality"** (Activity_1twduio) **three times** in instance 1, exceeding the UoC constraint of **1 maximum execution** specified in the parent task **Unnamed** (Activity_1fx8kp5).

From the **simulation log**:

- At **startTime=336**, **evaluator2** performed **"Evaluate project quality"** with **numberOfExecutions=3**.

The **BPMN diagram** shows that **Activity_1fx8kp5** has a UoC constraint (`security:Mth="1"`) on **"Evaluate project quality"**, limiting each user to a single execution per instance.

##### **Suggested Fix:**

1. **Limit Task Execution Per User:**
   - Ensure that **evaluator2** executes **"Evaluate project quality"** only once per instance.

2. **Utilize Other Evaluators:**
   - Assign additional qualified evaluators such as **evaluator1**, **evaluator3**, or **evaluator4** to handle the remaining executions of the task.

3. **Reassess UoC Threshold (If Necessary):**
   - If operational requirements necessitate multiple executions by a single evaluator, consider increasing the UoC threshold after evaluating potential risks.
