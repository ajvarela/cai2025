### **Violation 1:**
- **Violation Type:** "UoC"
- **Parent Task ID and Name:** "Make a decision about project" (Activity_1pfd2dv)
- **Subtask(s) ID and Name:** "Make a decision about project" (Activity_0bcw6ho)
- **User(s) Involved:** "technician2"

##### **Reason for Occurrence:**
The violation occurred because technician2 executed the task "Make a decision about project" (Activity_0bcw6ho) more than the allowed threshold of 2 times, as indicated in the simulation log at timestamps 216, 374, and 585 for instances 2, 4, and 7, respectively. This task is under the parent task "Make a decision about project" (Activity_1pfd2dv), which has a UoC constraint set to 2.

##### **Suggested Fix:**
To address this violation, consider increasing the UoC threshold for task "Make a decision about project" (Activity_0bcw6ho) if the current limit is too restrictive for the workflow. Alternatively, reassign some instances of this task to other users to distribute the workload more evenly and prevent exceeding the threshold.

Similar to Violation 4, this task falls under the parent task "Evaluate project quality" (Activity_1fx8kp5) with a UoC constraint of 1.

##### **Suggested Fix:**
Adjust the UoC threshold for task "Evaluate project quality" (Activity_1twduio) according to the workflow needs. Alternatively, reassign tasks among users to prevent threshold violations.

### **Violation 6:**
- **Violation Type:** "UoC"
- **Parent Task ID and Name:** "Evaluate project quality" (Activity_1fx8kp5)
- **Subtask(s) ID and Name:** "Evaluate project quality" (Activity_1twduio)
- **User(s) Involved:** "allLane1"

##### **Reason for Occurrence:**
The violation occurred because allLane1 executed the task "Evaluate project quality" (Activity_1twduio) more than the allowed threshold of 1 time, as shown in the simulation log at timestamp 824 for instance 8. This task is also under the parent task "Evaluate project quality" (Activity_1fx8kp5) with a UoC constraint.

##### **Suggested Fix:**
Consider adjusting the UoC threshold for task "Evaluate project quality" (Activity_1twduio) to accommodate the workflow. Alternatively, redistribute task assignments to avoid exceeding the threshold.

### **Violation 7:**
- **Violation Type:** "BoD"
- **Parent Task ID and Name:** "Unnamed" (Activity_1xtsdxu)
- **Subtask(s) ID and Name:** "Finish the project" (Activity_0rhq2zz) and "Fill out project application" (Activity_1lsjzdf)
- **User(s) Involved:** "company1" and "company2"

##### **Reason for Occurrence:**

- **Subtask(s) ID and Name:** "Add companies" (Activity_17ptqba) and "Evaluate project" (Activity_1conkxb)
- **User(s) Involved:** "allLane1"

##### **Reason for Occurrence:**
This violation occurred because the same user, allLane1, executed both tasks "Add companies" (Activity_17ptqba) and "Evaluate project" (Activity_1conkxb), violating the SoD constraint set by the parent task "Unnamed" (Activity_0xf32a2). The simulation log shows an instance of this violation at timestamp 10 for instance 10.

##### **Suggested Fix:**
Ensure that tasks "Add companies" (Activity_17ptqba) and "Evaluate project" (Activity_1conkxb) are assigned to different users for each instance to comply with the SoD constraint.

### **Violation 10:**
- **Violation Type:** "SoD"
